## Staging Your Changes

1. Once you have completed your work and before you push your changes back to **GitHub**, you will need to first **stage** the file that you have changed which is **lab6.php**. If you modified any of the others files thatn make sure that these files also get staged.
2. In **Visual Studio Code** you should see a **1** next to the **Source Control** icon in the sidebar.
3. Click on the **Source Control** icon.
4. You will then see the letter **M** next to the **lab5.php** file. This means that the file has been modified.
5. Hover your mouse over **lab6.php** and you will see a **+** symbol appear.
6. Click on the **+** symbol. This will add your file to the **Git staging area**.
7. Now where you see the text box above you should see an area where you can type a message.
8. Enter the text **Lab No. 6 Submission**.
9. Click the **check mark**. This will **commit** your changes.
10. You are now ready to push your changes back to **GitHub**.
11. To push your work to **GitHub** bring up the **VS Code command palette** (Control+Shift+P on PC and Command+Shift+P on Mac).
12. Enter **git push** and then press enter.
13. Your work will then get magically sent back to **GitHub**.
14. To check to see if your changes made it to **GitHub**, go to the URL of your repository and enter it into your browser. You will find this URL in the assignment. Click on it and it will take you to a page where you can find your **repo URL**.
15. You will then be brought to your repository. Click one on the lab5.php file to see if your code is there.
16. Please ask for help if you run into any problems or have any questions.
17. There is nothing you need to submit on Canvas. The instructor will use your GitHub repo as your submission for this lab.
